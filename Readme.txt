A simple local media player. I like finer speed controls on media. I use this tool to consume or review local media.

I'm picky. When speed watching on VLC it feels choppy, like frames are missing or skipped or something. Other media players like Quicktime are too basic, or limiting in max-speed, or UI awkwardness. I've always liked how Blink browsers handle speed controls (I love [Video Speed Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) extension, and match keyboard shortcuts). Blink recently removed the 400% audio-playback cap too.

The code is a bit of a mess, but is a single file with no dependencies. 

## Shortcuts: 

- `space` - pause/play
- `d` - speed up by 10%
- `s` - slow down by 10%
- `r` - reset playback to 100%
- `shift+n` - `n * 100` will be the playback speed
- `esc` - show/hide controls bar
